<h3><u><strong>Selenium WebDriver Structure Center:</strong></u></h3>

<p>Selenium WebDriver Training Online one of the most essential part of SELENIUM Launches and on which present Automation business entirely rely on, specifically if we say Open Source Community.</p>

<p>What&#39;s WebDriver in simple and easy language if we say then It is an API thats easy to explore and understand, which help us to make our tests easier to read and maintain. WebDriver isn&#39;t associated with any kind of Test Framework or Tool and this makes this API more useful as we are able to make use of the same as per our requirements or information of other integration open sources like JUNIT, TESTNG etc.</p>

<ul>
	<li>A well constructed Object Oriented API that provides improved support for web-app testing difficulties.</li>
	<li>Supports dynamic webpages where element of a Page may alter without the Page itself being reloaded.</li>
	<li>All the constraints of SELENIUM RC rectified in this Selenium WebDriver Tutorial Online.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Selenium RC Limits:</strong></h3>

<ol>
	<li>Work using javascript injection results in same origin policy dilemmas. Web Driver overcomes this restriction with driver for each browser.</li>
	<li>RC indicates Remote Control, while executing tests using Selenium RC it&#39;s obvious to have Selenium RC Server between Application under test &amp; Test Automation Package.</li>
	<li>This methodology of Client Server structure of Selenium RC makes it slower then Selenium Web Driver Training.</li>
	<li>Redundancy of commands</li>
	<li>RC cannot support headless browser but WebDriver can.</li>
	<li>WebDriver Structure</li>
</ol>

<p>WebDriver implemented on Layered Design, the notion behind this execution is more and much more usage of WebDriver for automation and this might be possible by meeting finest fit languages.Effectuation of WebDriver is that each browser has a language that is most natural to use when trying to drive it. Drivers are constructed according to the very best fit language and we are able to merely begin to see the wrapper around them.</p>

<p>We can declare that for any of browser driver if any of the attributes functions there in one binding language then it should be easy to incorporate support to other binding languages also.Web Driver is a compact Object Oriented API which could directly interacts together with the Program under evaluations.WebDriver utilizes the browser native compatibility to automation without using any peripheral entity.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Features of WebDriver:</strong></u></h3>

<p>Interface WebDriver, which represents an idealized internet browser employed for testing.<br />
Three categories of methods in this category:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Command to browser</li>
	<li>WebElements choice</li>
	<li>Debugging</li>
</ol>

<p>We discussed above about language bindings with browsers and it is just a thin wrapper that&#39;s shown for us to write code depending on our needs. This prospects WebDriver to to guide Multiple Languages in addition to Multiple Support Browsers which indicates that if any API supports several languages then this automatically leads to Multiple Platforms.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Multiple Languages Binding SUPPORT</li>
	<li>Multiple Help Browsers SUPPORT</li>
	<li>Multiple Platforms SUPPORT</li>
</ul>

<u><strong>Speed difference between RC and WebDriver:</strong></u></h3>

<p>WebDriver one to one communication with Program under Evaluation makes it quicker than RC as RC creates an additional interface between communications which is RC Server makes it likes Client Server Communication.</p>

<ul>
	<li>WebDriver: Is an interface comes under this program of Selenium Webdriver Training Online as well as a sub interface of SearchContext. SearchContext consists of Selenium WebDriver Tutorial Online &amp; WebElement as a sub interfaces.</li>
	<li>WebDriver: Lets see what all Selenium WebDriver <span style="line-height: 20.8px;">Training&nbsp;</span>contains, for example: - What exactly is FirefoxDriver: is a Selenium WebDriver Tutorial that will be used to socialize with WebApps. So, this means that all of the drivers should have each of the <a href="http://seleniumtestingtraining.com/selenium-testing-training-tutorial-online/" target="_blank">executions which are contracted</a> in the Selenium&nbsp;WebDriver Training interfaces and most of the Drivers may be called as WebDriver.</li>
	<li>Drivers Help: Types executing in Interface Selenium WebDriver Tutorial Online&nbsp;SUPPORT</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
At high level if we can say then Driver indicates as per the selection of the Explorer driver will probably be chosen and Driver will be utilized to connect to Web Page.Web Page consists of Web Components and these Driverss will talk to the Website.For communicating with Web Page means communication with Components present on the Web Page like for instance: Text Boxes, Buttons, Hyperlinks etc. WebElement a sub interface of SearchContext comes in to picture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Above table provides us all the procedures which we are able to use to interact with WebElements on Webpage but now for performing some of the operation on Web Element, we need to seek out element first on Web Page according to the above mentioned table and approach findElement(). For locating component on Webpage, We want address/locator of the component and we can attain this.<br />
WebDriver:- In depth under that what all Selenium WebDriver Training Online comprises of.</p>

<h3><strong>Highlights:</strong></h3>

<ol>
	<li>WebDriver: One of the very most core component from Selenium webdriver Tutorial.</li>
	<li>WebDriver: With huge features where driver covers all the qualities and attributes of explorers</li>
	<li>WebDriver: Gives us the opportunity to write-once and run on multiple platforms</li>
	<li>WebDriver: Supplies speed to Selenium Webdriver Training design where communication with Program under Test becomes faster</li>
	<li>WebDriver: Despite of working on any language or environment you do not need to to learn anything new it&#39;s just catch the knowledge and start producing consequences</li>
	<li>WebDriver: Gives chance to investigate something from center and can lend from scratch till end in Automation procedure</li>
	<li>WebDriver: Introduce AndroidDriver and IphoneDriver to research Mobile world</li>
</ol>
